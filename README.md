# ArcherTracking - JugenForscht 2020-2022
## Description
This project (and "research") had the target to track motion via inertial sensors. It was to be used on an archer to analyse their stance while shooting and help them improve. The finished system is supposed to consist of the users phone and the sensors attached to the shooters body, communicating per BluetoothLowEnergy. It was submitted twice to a competition (Jugendforscht 2021 + Jugendforscht 2022).<br>

## Current progress
This project is deprecated! It was split into three parts, which can be found here:

- [ArcherTracking-main]()
- [ArcherTracking-Visualisation]()
- [ArcherTracking-MotionRecognition]()

## What works?
- Visualisation works with OpenSim and an USB-Connection and can be found [here](https://github.com/Escape9002/ArcherTracking/tree/main/MATLAB/TestsNTutorials/Tests)!
- Sending data from one sensor to the phone works and can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/Escape9002/ArcherTracking/releases/tag/v1.0_ArcherTracking)! It is possible that older Releases don't come with the correct APK or Firmware, please use the most recent one!

## Documentation
A (german) documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Escape9002/ArcherTracking/tree/main/Documentation) for either the 2022-Projectversion or the more recent 2022-Projectversion. There you can find more details on how and why it all works, what future targets were and naturally, problems I encountered.
